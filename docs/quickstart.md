# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get Flowfile up and running quickly.

## Recommended Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+

### Installation & Running

Install and run Flowfile from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install flowfile
flowfile run ui
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+
- Poetry (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwardvaneechoud/flowfile
cd flowfile
```

2. Install Python dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

cd flowfile_frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

You'll need to start three components in separate terminals:

1. Start the Worker service:
```bash
# In first terminal
poetry run flowfile_worker  # Starts on port 63579
```

2. Start the Core service:
```bash
# In second terminal
poetry run flowfile_core   # Starts on port 63578
```

3. Start the frontend application:
```bash
# In third terminal
cd flowfile_frontend
npm run dev               # Starts Electron app (frontend on port 3000)
```

## Verifying Installation

Once all services are running, you should be able to:

1. Access the worker service at `http://localhost:63579`
2. Access the core service at `http://localhost:63578`
3. See the Electron application window open automatically

The application is now ready to use! You can start creating your first data flow by dragging nodes onto the canvas.
