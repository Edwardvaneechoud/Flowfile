# Core Concepts

Understanding the key concepts behind Flowfile's Python API will help you build better pipelines.

## Available Guides

### üì¶ [FlowFrame and FlowGraph](design-concepts.md)
The fundamental building blocks of Flowfile pipelines.

**You'll learn:**
- What FlowFrame is and how it differs from DataFrames
- How FlowGraph tracks your operations
- Why everything is lazy by default
- How visual and code representations connect

**Key takeaways:**
- FlowFrame = Your data + its transformation history
- FlowGraph = The complete pipeline blueprint
- Every operation creates a node in the graph

---

### üìù [Formula Syntax](expressions.md)
Flowfile's Excel-like formula syntax for expressions.

**You'll learn:**
- When to use `[column]` vs `ff.col("column")`
- Supported operations and functions
- How formulas translate to Polars
- Best practices for each syntax

**Key takeaways:**
- Formulas make simple operations more readable
- Great for users coming from Excel/Tableau
- Both syntaxes can be mixed in the same pipeline

## Quick Overview

### FlowFrame vs DataFrame

| DataFrame (Pandas/Polars) | FlowFrame (Flowfile) |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Holds data in memory | Always lazy (data not loaded) |
| Operations execute immediately | Operations build a plan |
| No operation history | Full operation history in graph |
| Can't visualize workflow | Can open in visual editor |

### The Lazy Advantage

```python
# This doesn't load the 10GB file!
df = ff.read_csv("huge_file.csv")

# Still no data loaded - just building the plan
df = df.filter(ff.col("country") == "USA")
df = df.select(["id", "amount"])

# NOW it loads only what's needed
result = df.collect()  # Might only read 100MB!
```

### Visual Integration

Every FlowFrame knows its history:

```python
# Build a complex pipeline
pipeline = (
    ff.read_csv("input.csv")
    .filter(ff.col("active") == True)
    .group_by("category")
    .agg(ff.col("revenue").sum())
)

# See the entire pipeline visually
ff.open_graph_in_editor(pipeline.flow_graph)

# The graph shows all 4 operations as connected nodes
```

## Why These Concepts Matter

Understanding these concepts helps you:

1. **Write efficient code** - Leverage lazy evaluation
2. **Debug effectively** - Visualize your pipeline
3. **Collaborate better** - Share visual representations
4. **Optimize performance** - Understand what executes when
