## The Best of Both Worlds

The beauty of Flowfile is that **you don't have to choose**. You can:

- üìù Write code and visualize it instantly with `open_graph_in_editor()`
- üé® Build visually and export as Python code
- üîÑ Switch between visual and code at any time
- üë• Collaborate across technical and non-technical teams

## Quick Examples

### Visual Approach
1. Drag a "Read Data" node onto canvas
2. Add a "Filter" node and connect them
3. Configure filter conditions in the form
4. Run and see results instantly

### Code Approach
```python
import flowfile as ff

df = ff.read_csv("data.csv")
result = df.filter(ff.col("amount") > 100)
ff.open_graph_in_editor(result.flow_graph)  # See it visually!
```
