# Nodes Overview  

Flowfile's nodes are the **building blocks** of your data pipeline. Each node performs a specific operation, allowing you to **load, transform, combine, summarize, and output** data without writing code.  

By connecting nodes together, you can create **flexible and scalable workflows** to process data efficiently.

## **Node Categories**  

Flowfile nodes are grouped into five main categories:  

- **Input Nodes** – Load data from files, databases, or external sources.  
- **Transform Nodes** – Modify, clean, and reshape your data.  
- **Combine Nodes** – Merge, join, or match multiple datasets.  
- **Aggregate Nodes** – Summarize, group, and compute metrics.  
- **Output Nodes** – Save data to files or explore it interactively.

## **How Nodes Work**  

Each node is designed to be **intuitive and consistent**, ensuring a smooth workflow experience:  

✔ **Clear inputs and outputs** – Easily understand what data flows into and out of each node.  
✔ **Visual feedback** – Monitor the data transformation process.  
✔ **Preview capability** – Inspect results before applying changes.  
✔ **Error handling** – Validate and debug data issues efficiently.  

Flowfile’s node-based approach makes data processing **fast, flexible, and code-free**, helping you build **powerful data pipelines with ease**.
