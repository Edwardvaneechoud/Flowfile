## Technical Design

Flowfile operates as three interconnected services:

- **Designer** (Electron + Vue): Visual interface for building data flows
- **Core** (FastAPI): ETL engine using Polars for data transformations (`:63578`)
- **Worker** (FastAPI): Handles computation and caching of data operations (`:63579`)

Each flow is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent data operations and edges represent data flow between operations.

For a deeper dive into the technical architecture, check out [this article](https://dev.to/edwardvaneechoud/building-flowfile-architecting-a-visual-etl-tool-with-polars-576c) on how Flowfile leverages Polars for efficient data processing.

## Example use cases

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Complex joins (fuzzy matching)
- Text to rows transformations
- Advanced filtering and grouping
- Custom formulas and expressions
- Filter data based on conditions

### Data Integration
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Fuzzy matching of customer records
- Standardize data formats
- Handle messy Excel files

### ETL Operations
- Excel to database pipelines
- Data quality checks

### Code Generation & Conversion
- **Flow to Code:** Convert your visual flows into Python scripts.
- **Code to Flow:** Automatically generate a visual flow from your existing Python code.

Learn how to build pipelines programmatically with the [Flowfile Frame API](guides/flowfile_frame_api.md).

## Getting Started

### Building Your First Flow

Flowfile allows you to create data pipelines visually:

1. Click **Create** to start a new `.flowfile`
2. Drag nodes from the left sidebar onto the canvas
3. Connect nodes by dragging between them
4. Configure each node by clicking on it
5. Click **Run** to execute your flow
6. Click on nodes after running to preview results

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- Make (optional, for build automation)

### Installation & Running

#### From PyPI
```bash
pip install flowfile
flowfile run ui
````

Using Make:
```bash
make all               # Install and build everything
make clean            # Clean build artifacts
```

Manual installation:
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
poetry install

# Start services (in separate terminals)
poetry run flowfile_worker  # Starts worker on :63579
poetry run flowfile_core   # Starts core on :63578

# Start desktop app
cd flowfile_frontend
npm install
npm run dev               # Starts Electron app (frontend on :3000)
```
